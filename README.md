  <h2 style="margin-top:1.5rem; font-size:1.35rem;">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>SimInterview</strong> is a large language model (LLM)-based multilingual interview training system for business professionals entering the AI-transformed job market. 
    It simulates realistic interviews through LLM agents and synthetic AI technologies, enabling personalized, culturally adaptive conversations across multiple languages. 
    The framework combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with models such as OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, and Gemma 3, integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto talking-head generation, and ChromaDB for vector retrieval. 
    Experiments with university candidates show strong alignment with job requirements, accurate resume-based questioning, and high engagement—particularly with the lightweight Gemma 3 model. 
    The system demonstrates how contestable AI design and human-in-the-loop principles can support transparent, bias-aware interview simulation for cross-cultural business education.
